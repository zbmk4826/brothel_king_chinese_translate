    #### HOW IT WORKS ####
    ## Threats builds up every night depending on total security, with a minimum of 1.
    ## The brothel starts at alert level 1. After threat reaches 10, 30 and 50, an event happens.
    ## Some events cause escalation to a higher alert level. There are 3 alert levels.
    ## After a security event happens (not escalating), threat is reset to 0.

    ## Pick targets for attacks

    ## Get event type
